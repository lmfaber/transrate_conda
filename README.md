# Conda recipes for [TransRate](https://github.com/blahah/transrate)
May not be the cleanest recipe. There are a lot of errors popping up during conda-build process. However the tool is still functional once installed.

Tested on: Ubuntu 18.10 and Debian GNU/Linux 9.6 (stretch)

I used the recipe and uploaded it to a [private repository](https://anaconda.org/lmfaber/transrate). TransRate can be downloaded and installed via
```
conda install -c lmfaber transrate
```
